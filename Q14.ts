// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

var guestList:string [] = ["Zeeshan Ghani", "Adnan Khalil", "Asif Ali Bhutta"];
guestList.forEach((guestName) => 
{
    console.log(`Dear ${guestName}, You are invited for a valuable Dinner at Sareena Faisalabad please join us`); 
});
