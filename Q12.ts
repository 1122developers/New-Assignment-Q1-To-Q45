// // Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// var names1:string [] = ["Zeeshan Ghani", "Adnan Khalil", "Asif Ali Bhutta", "Junaid Sabri", "Zeeshan Shafi"];
// console.log("Hi" names1[0], "Good Morning, have a nice day");
